Hello world!

This is my first foray into Github - very exiting! 

I am a Maths graduate (class of 2008!), and have been teaching secondary level Maths (age 11 - 18) since then. I have always been mad about anything to do with computers.... Once upon a time I was planning to do a computer science degree but sadly had a very uninspiring A-Level teacher. In contrast I had a very inspiring Maths teacher! As cheesy as it sounds, after university I wanted to spend some time inspiring others in the same way that I was, and I have thoroughly enjoyed being able to do this. In fact, I have a real passion for teaching and in instilling a love of Maths in others and helping them achieve their full potential. 

I am now at the point, thouhg, where I want to develop my original love: using logic and Mathematics to solve hard and real world problems in intelligent ways, and "controlling computers," as Saron of the Codenewbie podcast said at one point. I am not sure if Github is the place for this, but I am planning to document my own "coding journey."
