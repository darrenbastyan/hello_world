Hello world!

This is my first foray into Github - very exiting! 

I am a Maths graduate (class of 2008!), and have been teaching secondary level Maths (age 11 - 18) since then. I have always been mad aboutanything to do with computers.... Once upon a time I was planning to do a computer science degree but sadly had a very uninspiring A-Level teacher. In contrast I had a very inpiring Maths teacher! As cheasy as it sounds, after university I wanted to spend some time inspiring others in the same way that I was, and I have enjoyed being able to do this... I am now at the point where I have remembered my true passion: using logic and Mathematics to solve hard and real world problems in intelligent ways, and "controlling computers," as Ceron of the Codenewbie podcast said at one point. I am not sure if Github is the place for this, but I am planning to document my own "coding journey."
